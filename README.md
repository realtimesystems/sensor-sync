Sensors Are Synchronized To A Common Time Base

Our synchronized sensors produce data at exactly the time and frequency specified.
The associated jitter is minimal, and we describe how to treat time-jitter in any analysis where sensor fusion is required.
Furthermore, two or more sensors can be synchronized to each other and generate data with a microsecond of each other.

Our products can also synchronized to GPS signals, allowing two or more sensors generate data synchronously,
and within microseconds of each other. The sensors could be across the globe.

# Why Synchronous Data
Synchronicity is a poorly-appreciated concept.
Most technologically advanced people (scientists, engineers, etc.) understand the concept of a synchronized sensor.
It is not until one has to work with multiple sensors to perform a task (robotics, manufacturing, etc.) does the concept
really hit home. The effects of dealing with sensors acquiring data at different rates,
